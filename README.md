# PERFECT PUZZLE

A sliding-puzzle web app built with React + TypeScript and Vite. Upload any image, crop the portion you want to use, choose a grid size (2x2 — 12x12) and play a sliding-tile puzzle generated from your crop.

Live demo: https://sayakaono.github.io/sliding-puzzle/

## Features

- Upload an image and crop the exact area to use for the puzzle (react-image-crop).
- Choose grid sizes from 2x2 up to 12x12.
- Works on desktop and mobile (touch/click).
- Built with modern stack: React 19, TypeScript, Vite.

## Quick start

Clone and install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SayakaOno/sliding-puzzle.git
cd sliding-puzzle
npm install
```

Run dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## How to use

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Select a grid size from the selector (default is 3x3).
3. Upload an image.
4. Use the crop UI to select the portion of the image you want used for the puzzle.
   - A preview canvas displays the crop.
5. Click "Start Game" to generate the puzzle from the cropped image.
6. Play by clicking or tapping tiles adjacent to the empty space to slide them into place.

Notes:
- The UI enables starting the game only after a valid crop has been created.
- Larger grid sizes (e.g., 10x10+) increase the number of tiles and may be slower on low-powered devices.
